- Start and Stop should be under the right click menu instead of under File
- Top menu should also contain Calculate and Sort
	- Calculate
		- Shows feed in the main compatment
	- Sort
		- Sort by brings up a radio menu with sort options, a confirm button and a cancel button
		- Sort by deadline, size, category, alpha? 
- About should have a usage guide
- Deadline needs a calender format or something
- Clicking on a task should display all its info on the main panel, with an edit button (buggy)
- Null fields should not be displayed, or show "none"  --fixed -- victor
